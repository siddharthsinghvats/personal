    <h2>Did your heart smile at the last breath?</h2>
   <p>

    It is not about going up or down,<br>
    Sometimes you are an ordinary person,<br>
    And sometimes it is you who wears the crown. <br>
   <br>

    It is not about getting it always right,<br> 
    But when you get it wrong, <br>
    Either you stay calm or indulge in a mental fight. <br>
     <br>
    It is not about ignorance or care, <br>
    But when you are left alone, <br>
    It is about how much you dare. <br>
   <br>
    It is not about poor or rich, <br>
    It is about what you preach. <br>
    <br>
    
    It is not about being happy or sad, <br>
    Remember the last night a homeless had. <br>
     <br>
    It is not about what others think, <br>
    Your own deeds should not cause your heart to shrink. <br>
    <br>
    It is not about what you gained or lost, <br>
    Your will power in the turbulence has the higjest cost. <br>
 <br>
    It is not about life or death, <br>
    But did your heart smile at the last breath? <br>
   </p>
